# Project Proposal

# Project Name
Research@NYU

# What and Why?
This project would help connect students and professors interested in doing research at NYU.
Professors would be able to post about their research and also look for students who are looking to help in their labs/TA for certain classes. 
Students would also be able to connect with professors who are interested in mentoring for student research proposals, find labs in their field of interest, and even connect with other students interested in similar topics.
NYU has a vast network of professors and students who are interested in reseraching different topics and by making a dedicated app to facilitate that networking is going to allow more students access to research opportunities and will allow professors to easily find students who are interested in helping with their research.

# For Whom
This is for students at NYU who are interested in research and don't necessarily know who to reach out to or how to get started. It is also for professors who are open to mentoring highly motivated students or looking for help on their own research projects

# How
Main features:
* Students can create profiles where they can add their research interests and whether or not they are interested in finding a mentor/collaborating with other students on a research proposal or if they are interested in joining a lab.
* Professors can create profiles where they add their areas of research, previous works, and what they are currently working on. THey can also inidcate whether or not they are interested in potentially being a mentor for a student's research proposal or whether or not they are looking for students to fill openings in a lab/help them in some other way.
* In addition to being able to reach out to professors who are interested in taking on mentee's the web applications has strategies and tips for reaching out to professors and inquiring about lab openings.

The web application will need a user-interface and a database to store the user information and the tips for the student users.

# Scope
I think this project would be able to be completed by 4-5 students in one semester.
